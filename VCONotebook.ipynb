    "*Fig. 1 Basic Schematic of LC-VCO*\n",
    "  \n",
    "The LC-VCO, as stated in the name, relies on an LC tank circuit that resonates at a target center frequency. The parallel inductor and capacitor will resonate at a frequency dependent on their values, but they also have parasitic resistances associated with them. This resistance, most prominent in the inductor, causes any produced tones to quickly diminish, defeating the purpose of the oscillator. In order to counteract this effect, we can include a second resistor in parallel with the RLC tank that creates an equivalent negative resistance to the parasitics faced. To realize this \"negative resistance\", we can use a cross-coupled pair (XCP) circuit, which creates a negative transconductance looking into the circuit. Additionally, if you replace the capacitor in the tank with a varactor, one can easily tune the resonant frequency of the LC tank, creating a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Parameters\n",
    "The target frequency for this VCO is 2.4GHz. This frequency was decided upon because of its extensive usage between IoT, BLE, WiFi, and more. In future revisions, 20GHz and 40GHz implementations will also be explored. Equation (1) describes the ideal relationship between the LC tank values and its resonant frequency. \n",
    "$$\\omega=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "For this oscillator, an inductance value of 2nH was chosen, primarily for its size and potential for a high Q-factor. Using the above equation, an ideal capacitance of around 2.2pF is derived. Now that the LC tank values have been chosen, we must inspect the behavior of the circuit during oscillation. The main sources of loss in this circuit will stem from the quality of the inductor $Q_{L}$, the quality of the capacitor $Q_{C}$, and the output impedance of the XCP circuit $Z_{o}$. In order for this circuit to sustain oscillation, the transconductance $g_{m}$ of the XCP must be greater than the losses faced in the circuit. \n",
    "$$g_{m}>\\alpha \\left( Z_{o}+\\frac{1}{Q_{L}\\omega{}L}+\\frac{\\omega{}C}{Q_{C}} \\right) \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "$$Q_{L}=\\frac{\\omega{}L}{R_{L}}, Q_{C}=\\frac{1}{\\omega{}C R_{C}} \\tag{3}$$\n",
    "$$\\alpha{} > 3 \\tag{4}$$\n",
    "Equation (4) provides a safety margin $\\alpha$ for startup. We can then use this in equation (2) to calculate the minimum required transconductance of the XCP, where the quality factors are described in equation (3). We will revisit these equations later in this paper to correctly design the XCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inductor Derivation\n",
    "ASITIC was used to realize the planar inductors needed to create the LC tank. ASITIC provides an excellent tool for optimizing inductor layouts based on Q-factor and inductance for given size parameters. Because ASITIC does not natively support DRC rules, square inductors are used to keep it DRC-clean for SKY130. The 2nH inductor was derived in ASITIC using the following:\n",

    "Extracting a pi-equivalent circuit model of the inductor, as depicted in Figure 2, is the next step. This is an instrumental part of the process; the parasitic series resistance within the inductor will play a large role in the creation of the VCO core later on. There are 2 ways this can be accomplished in ASITIC; `pi` will calculate the equivalent circuit, whereas `pi2` will attempt to extract it using EM analysis. Because both return theoretical results that are only accurate to some degree, an average of the two should be sufficient for most approximations. Once you have extracted the series resistance of the inductor, you can use equation (5) to calculate the equivalent parallel resistance:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Varactor Calculations\n",
    "To implement the tuning functionality of this LC-VCO, varactors are used in place of a conventional capacitor in the LC tank circuit. This provides a way to adjust the reactance of the capacitors with a tuning voltage, which will consequently alter the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. However, conceiving accurate simulations with the current SKY130 varactor models has proven difficult because of their non-continuous nature. To overcome this, the measurement data provided by CoolCAD of a few varactor test structures were used. \n",

    "\n",
    "The measured behavior of m56 parallel 5x10 micron varactors has been graphed above. This data [1] can be used to roughly approximate the behavior of the 5x10 varactor, which can be used to build a varactor large enough for the LC tank. In this circuit example, we will assume that we want the target resonant frequency of 2.4GHz to be achieved through a tuning voltage of 0. To account for this, take the $C_{BC}$ of the varactor such that $V_{BC}=0$ and divide by the target capacitance derived in (1). Neglecting parasitics, we have derived that around 16 parallel 5x10 micron varactors will achieve the needed 2.2pF capacitance needed for a 2.4GHz resonance at $V_{tune}=0$. Of course, the floorplanning and matching of the varactors will affect this figure, and so parasitic extraction will be needed later to account for this. One can then use the previously measured data to extract the ideal resonance of the tank circuit as $V_{BC}$ varies over some range. This will allow you to understand the tuning range of the circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "## VCO Core Design\n",
    "With the theoretical behavior of the inductor-varactor tank circuit and the required negative resistance now understood, an adequate cross-coupled pair can be constructed. To understand how this design will be derived, let us first examine how exactly an XCP works. \n",

    "\n",
    "Analyzing the small signal model of the cross-coupled pair in Figure 4 (b) allows us to derive and analyze its behavior. With known parasitic capacitances and resistances such as $C_{o}$, $C_{gd}$, and $r_{o}$ we can find the impedance as modeled in (6). These parasitics have been abstracted as $Z_{o1}$ and $Z_{o2}$ in Figure 4 (c).\n",
    "$$Z_{o}=r_{o}\\parallel(j\\omega{}C_{o}+4j\\omega{}C_{gd}) \\tag{6}$$\n",
    "and the according admittance $Y$ can be found from the reciprocal $Z_{o}^{-1}$. Additionally, conducting nodal analysis on Figure 4 (b) yields that the input resistance of the circuit can be modeled by:\n",
    "$$R_{in}=-\\frac{2}{g_{m}} \\tag{7}$$\n",
    "From the extracted ASITIC inductor model, we learned that the series resistance of the inductor is close to 2.9 ohms and the Q-factor is around 10.3. We can use equation (5) to derive a parallel resistance of around 315 ohms. From here, we use equation (7) to find our target transconductance for the XCP, which happens to be around 6.349 mS. This figure should be cross-checked with equation (2) to ensure that this meets the startup conditions. After running characterization tests on the `nfet_01v8` device, it has been concluded that a $\\frac{W}{L}$ of $\\frac{26}{0.15}$ is suitable for meeting this specification. Now that the elementary specifications of the circuit have been derived, a basic circuit without the use of varactors can be constructed. This circuit has been outlined in Figure 5. \n",

    "There are a few things that should be noted from this circuit. First, the 2nH inductor has been split into two 1nH inductors to allow for a center tap. Second, the series resistance of the inductor has been modeled by a parallel resistance of 315 ohms. Lastly, the varactors have been temporarily replaced by a 2.2pF capacitor for simplicity. The last step to completing a simulation-ready circuit is to find the bias current $I_{bias}$. To start with, the bias current should match the admittance of the XCP, which can be found by the reciprocal of equation (3). The designer can then use intuition to experiment with the bias current level until the result is satisfactory. In the case of this example design, an `nfet_01v8` of size $\\frac{60}{0.15}$ was used as a starting point. \n",

    "The final step of the circuit design is to design an output buffer. In the case where $50\\Omega+0j$ impedance probe pads are used, one will have to buffer the high impedance of the XCP down. Standard amplifier buffers, as shown in Figure 7, are used for this at each output node. \n",

    "Finally, Figure 10 displays the final layout of the VCO test structure. The inductor is the largest part of the layout, so being able to fit other components between its terminals would help to reduce the overall footprint of the VCO. The varactor banks and VCO core are laid out such that they fit in between the two inductor terminals, minimizing parasitics. The two output nodes are fed into GSG probe pads, and there are 4 more additional wire-bond pads for $V_{CC}$, $V_{tune}$, and ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "Verification with the current toolchain will be near impossible, as the current extraction method only support R+C+CC extraction. We will have to rely on the extracted inductance of the inductor layout from ASITIC's calculations. For simplicity, each individual component, such as the core and varactor bank, had PEX and LVS run individually. Once passed, the circuit was redesigned using any feedback from verification and rerun. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, the open source tools such as ASITIC, Klayout, ngspice, and magic were able to be used to derive a 2.4GHz LC-VCO in SkyWater's 130nm node. The VCO had a 2.4GHz center frequency with a 3% tuning range and 2.4mA power consumption at 0dBm output power. It started with deriving the basic design parameters for the circuit from design equations and realizing a suitable inductor using ASITIC. We then used the measured varactor data from [1] to create an appropriate varactor bank based on the required LC capacitance and tuning range. Finally, we created an XCP circuit while analyzing its small-signal behavior in order to create a suitable negative transconductance and input impedance. This was all laid out using Klayout and with attention to matching. This layout was then verified using magic's LVS and PEX capabilities. Though this tapeout has yet be to tested in a lab, we can expect good performance and a low margin of error. \n",
